# E-Learning-Platform-for-DSA
My Git Repo With Eclipse
## Overview
This project is an E-Learning Platform designed to assist individuals in learning and practicing Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). It provides a user-friendly interface for accessing educational content, quizzes, and coding challenges related to DSA.
## Features

- **Curriculum:** Well-organized DSA curriculum with lessons, quizzes, and challenges.
- **User Authentication:** Secure user authentication system for tracking individual progress.
- **Progress Tracking:** Monitor and track user progress through the curriculum.
- **Discussion Forum:** Platform for users to discuss problems, solutions, and share knowledge.
- **Responsive Design:** Mobile-friendly design for a seamless learning experience on various devices.
  ## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript ( a framework like Bootstrap).
- **Backend:** Java Servlets for handling server-side logic.
- **Dynamic Pages:** JavaServer Pages (JSP) for creating dynamic web pages.
- **Database:** JDBC for connecting to a relational database (e.g., MySQL).
- **Authentication:** Sessions for user authentication and authorization.
  ## Database Schema
  Tables:
users:

Columns:
user_id (Primary Key, Auto-increment): Unique identifier for each user.
username: User's username for authentication.
password: User's password (hashed and salted for security).
email: User's email address.
full_name: User's full name.
courses:

Columns:
course_id (Primary Key, Auto-increment): Unique identifier for each course.
course_name: Name of the DSA course.
description: Description of the DSA course.
created_at: Timestamp indicating when the course was created.
quizzes:

Columns:
quiz_id (Primary Key, Auto-increment): Unique identifier for each quiz.
lesson_id (Foreign Key): Reference to the lesson the quiz belongs to.
quiz_title: Title of the quiz.
questions: JSON array storing quiz questions.
created_at: Timestamp indicating when the quiz was created.
Relationships:
The users table is related to the user_progress table through the user_id field.
The courses table is related to the lessons table through the course_id field.
The lessons table is related to the quizzes table through the lesson_id field.
The users table is related to the forum_posts table through the user_id field.
The lessons table and quizzes table are related to the user_progress table through the lesson_id and quiz_id fields, respectively.
This database schema supports user authentication, course management, lesson content, quizzes, user progress tracking, and a discussion forum. Please adjust it based on your specific requirements and project structure.
